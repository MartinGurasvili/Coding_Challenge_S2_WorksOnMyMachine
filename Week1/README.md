# Password Generator
Starting off fun and relevant: We want you to create a user interface where a User can simply
generate a password String. Your web application should also be deployed and ready to use upon
the deadline. (Using a service like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS/Azure/GCP, etc are all
acceptable)

1) The password generator should generate passwords of various lengths that the User is able
to set.
2) It should have options to include/exclude different characters this being uppercase,
lowercase, special or numerical.
3) The interface should not be cluttered and should be designed appropriately with ease of use
prioritised.
4) BONUS: Ensure that testing of your application is made using a framework of your choice.
